**PRINJESHKUMAR SHAH**

### OBJECTIVE:
- Data science enthusiast with more than one year of experience in data science. Formally, I am about to complete post graduation in applied mathematics. 
- My short term goal is to engage in industry level projects of data analysis and machine learning and long term goal is to be able to create, develop and maintain ML/AI applications in two fields, namely, robotics and business.

### Previous work

## Machine learning for computer vision:
- This Project deals with multimodal action recognition. We aim to create a training robot which supports people in elderly homes by recognizing their gestures and activities and acting accordingly. It may support them in their everyday lives and further saves them when accidents occur.
- As a machine learning engineer, I assumed below responsibilities:
    1. Developing deep learning pipeline
- We published the version as a python library and it can be installed with below commands. 
`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps AcRec`
- For more information and documentation, please go to this page.
