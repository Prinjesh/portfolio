### OBJECTIVE:
My short term goal is to engage in industry and contribute in the entire ML lifecycle as a data scientist. My long term goal is to be able to govern an entire data team in industry projects. I am interested in mainly two types of industries: Engineering and Fintech/Finance.

### Projects:

1. Machine learning (Deep learning) for computer vision:</summary>

    - This Project is a part of University of Koblenz's research and it deals with multimodal action recognition. We aim to create a training robot which supports people in elderly homes by recognizing their gestures and activities and acting accordingly. It may support them in their everyday lives and further saves them when accidents occur.
    - I assumed a Machine learning engineer position in the team.
    - Responsibilities and roles:
        1. Developed a complete package of Machine learning pipeline.
        2. Pytorch lightning based ML pipeline
        3. Multiple integrated deep learning or machine learning models
        4. Tensorboard for dashboarding and visualization
        5. Worked with RGB, depth and IMU data during the entire work
        6. Linux development environment
        7. Co-ordinated with data engineering team for features engineering. Took initiative to implement my idea in engineering data in a better way. The performance of the model with the same data was improved by around 3 percent on testing set with the idea.
        8. We equiped Gitlab with CI/CD jobs and deployment using containerization technology (in our case, docker).
        9. Developed an Intent based Chatbot for HMI for the robot.
    - Competitions:
    For research and training purposes we took part in two online challenges where we created our first training routine. Those challenges were due on June 30th 2021 and our confidence paid off. We succeeded on both competitions and won against a few competitors:

    - OpenAcRec:
    The entire development is not open source and is propriatory to the University of Koblenz. However, OpenAcRec is an action library that is available for testing. It is still under development. With OpenAcRec we aim to develop an action recognition library that serves as a basis for unifying various datasets of various different modalities. You can install it with this command.
    `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps AcRec`

    - MAREC:
    MAREC is a prototypical machine which aims to apply our research methods on an actual robot that will be able to recognize human gestures and react/ interact accordingly.
